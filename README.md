🧾 Interactive Form Validation

📖 Project Overview

Interactive Form Validation is a web-based project designed to enhance user experience by providing real-time feedback during form filling. It ensures that users input valid data before submission, reducing errors and improving data accuracy.

The project validates various input fields such as name, email, password, phone number, and confirm password dynamically using JavaScript. It provides instant error messages, success indicators, and visual cues to guide the user.

🧩 Technology Stack

Technology	Purpose

HTML5	Structure of the form
CSS3	Styling and visual feedback (error/success colors)
JavaScript (ES6)	Logic for form validation and interactivity
Browser DOM APIs	Dynamic content updates

🧠 How It Works

1. User fills in the form fields (name, email, password, etc.).


2. As each field is filled, JavaScript event listeners check the validity using regular expressions and conditions.


3. If invalid data is detected, an error message and red border appear.


4. When corrected, the border turns green with a success tick icon.


5. On successful validation of all fields, the form can be submitted.
